**** Brief Introduction on Current Project ****
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery)

In this project, you'll get a chance to actually build a pretty nifty tool to flex your Javascript and jQuery muscles.

You're going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
